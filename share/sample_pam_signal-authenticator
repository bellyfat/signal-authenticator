# PAM configuration for the signal-authenticator service
#
# The default config is preserved in 
# /usr/local/share/signal-authenticator/sample_pam_signal-authenticator

auth	required	pam_permit.so
auth	required	pam_signal_authenticator.so --nullok

## Options for pam_signal_authenticator.so
# 
# `-n`, `--nullok` (recommended) allows users who have not opted in to bypass Signal
# authentication, does not apply if user tried to opt in but has a bad config
# 
# `-N`, `--nonull` requires all users to have properly setup Signal authentication
# (high chance of user locking themselves out of ssh)
# 
# `-p`, `--nostrictpermissions` (not recommended) allows users to make bad choices about 
# the permissions of their config files while still allowing them to use
# two-factor authentication
# 
# `-s`, `--silent` no warnings or errors will be written to the system log
# 
# `-d`, `--debug` print warnings and errors to the system log even if the `PAM_SILENT` flag is passed to PAM
# 
# `-I`, `--ignore-spaces` ignore spaces in user's response (allowed characters must not contain
# a space)
# 
# `-a`, `--add-space-every [n]` add a space every n characters so users can more easily
# read the token (implies `--ignore-spaces`)
# 
# `-D`, `--dbus` speed things up by using signal-cli's experimental system dbus interface (requires
# signal-authenticator.service to be enabled)
# 
# `-t`, `--time-limit [n]` tokens expire after n seconds. By default there is no
# time limit.
# 
# `-C`, `--allowed-chars [chars]` tokens will be made up of these characters only. The
# number of allowed characters must be a divisor of 256. The default allowed
# characters are `abcdefghjkmnpqrstuvwxyz123456789`.
# 
# `-T`, `--token-len [n]` sets the length of 1-time tokens. The default token
# length is 12.
